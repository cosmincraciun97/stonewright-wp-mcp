# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Seventeen native WooCommerce abilities covering runtime status, products,
  variations, catalog terms, global attributes, orders, sales, and bounded
  catalog audits.
- Explicit runtime integration discovery for supported and discovery-only
  builders, themes, blocks, forms, field plugins, add-ons, dynamic-data
  plugins, code tools, and SEO suites.
- Shared native rules, bounded memory generalization, response projection,
  Elementor unchanged-hash reads, and guarded escaped-layout decoding.
- Credential-free agent setup, mode-aware Prompt Library entries, and a
  step-by-step plugin/companion update guide in wp-admin.
- Fresh-install and upgrade lifecycle tests for memory, skills, and audit data.

### Changed

- WooCommerce catalog mutations now preview by default, use allowlisted native
  object APIs, enforce task context and permissions, require production
  confirmations where applicable, record audit entries, and verify readback.
- Production packages bootstrap through Jetpack's package-aware Composer
  loader and verify every generated manifest path.
- Persistent memory and skill writes reject high-confidence credential
  material. Existing user state and audit history remain intact on upgrade.

### Fixed

- Clean production dependency builds keep root dev autoload metadata out of
  Jetpack's optimized classmap and remove development-only paths that could
  make activation fail beside WooCommerce.
- Packaged generic skills seed through a release-scanned trusted path, while
  user-created skills cannot bypass credential guards by claiming built-in
  provenance.
- CI stages the plugin with the real release exclusions and rejects any
  resulting Jetpack manifest path that is absent from that staged package.
