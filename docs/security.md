# Security

The full security reference lives in [plugin/SECURITY.md](../plugin/SECURITY.md). This page provides additional context on the threat model and hardening recommendations.

## Summary

Stonewright enforces security at four layers:

1. **WordPress capabilities** — every ability checks a real capability before running.
2. **Pre-write backups** — every write that touches Elementor data or FSE styles snapshots the current state first.
3. **Confirmation tokens** — destructive operations require a short-lived, single-use token to proceed.
4. **Audit log** — every write is recorded in an append-only database table.

## Threat model

### Agent with excessive permissions

An MCP client that authenticates with an administrator account can call any ability, including destructive ones. Mitigations:

- Set `stonewright_mode` to `production-safe` to block all destructive abilities regardless of authentication level.
- Create a dedicated WordPress user with the minimum capabilities needed for the intended workflow. For read-only agents, `read` is sufficient. For content workflows, `editor` is usually enough.
- Rotate Application Passwords regularly.

### Compromised MCP client

If an MCP client is compromised, an attacker can issue ability calls on behalf of the authenticated user. Mitigations:

- Enable `production-safe` mode on all sites that are not development or staging.
- Monitor the audit log at `/wp-json/stonewright/v1/audit-log` for unexpected ability names or unusual argument patterns.
- Use the `ConfirmationToken` mechanism for any custom destructive abilities you add.

### Supply chain

Stonewright depends on `wordpress/mcp-adapter`, `wordpress/abilities-api`, and `opis/json-schema`. Check these dependencies for security advisories on each update. The Composer `composer.lock` file pins exact versions; review it when updating.

### Companion exposure

The companion Node server must not be exposed to the public internet. Run it on a private network or loopback interface and set `COMPANION_BEARER_TOKEN` and `COMPANION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` before starting it. The companion has access to Playwright (a full browser) and to the WordPress REST API; a compromised companion is equivalent to an authenticated editor-level session.

## Hardening checklist

- [ ] HTTPS enabled on the WordPress installation.
- [ ] `stonewright_mode` set to `production-safe` on production sites.
- [ ] Dedicated Application Password for the MCP client with the minimum required role.
- [ ] `COMPANION_BEARER_TOKEN` set to a strong random value.
- [ ] `COMPANION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` restricted to known request origins.
- [ ] Companion running on a private network only.
- [ ] Audit log monitored or exported to a centralized logging system.
- [ ] `WP_DEBUG` off in production (prevents diagnostic information leakage).
