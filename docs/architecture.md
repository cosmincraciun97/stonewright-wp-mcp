# Architecture

Stonewright has two parts:

- `plugin/`: the WordPress source of truth for abilities, permissions, memory,
  skills, Design Spec validation, rendering, backups, and audit logs.
- `companion/`: a Node sidecar for stdio MCP, optional HTTP MCP transport,
  health checks, optional MCP proxying, and tokenized WP-CLI.

```

## WordPress Writes

The plugin owns direct PHP runtime execution, permission checks,
production-safe confirmation tokens, backups, validation, and audit logging.
The companion can write by running tokenized WP-CLI commands requested by the
plugin or MCP client.

Use `stonewright/php-execute` for PHP snippets inside WordPress. WP-CLI
execution is tokenized and runs through `execFile`; WP-CLI PHP and shell entry
points are blocked.

## Agent Context

Agents must call MCP tool `stonewright-task-start` at the beginning of every
Stonewright task. It issues the same write context token while returning a
compact, task-aware response that includes:

- current instructions
- matched skill playbooks
- relevant memory
- required followups
- MCP tool naming hints
- recommended external MCPs such as Playwright for browser work
- a short-lived context token for write abilities

Manual edits to skills, memory, or custom instructions persist in WordPress and
are included in future task-start responses. `stonewright-context-bootstrap`
and `stonewright-workflow-preflight` remain compatibility paths.

If neither `stonewright-task-start` nor compatibility
`stonewright-context-bootstrap` is visible in the MCP tool list, the client has
not loaded Stonewright. Agents must stop WordPress work and ask for a client
reload or config fix instead of inspecting private client config files,
creating scratch helper scripts, creating helper JSON argument files, launching
the companion through ad hoc shell scripts, creating action scripts, inspecting
plugin/companion source to reverse-engineer tool schemas, hand-rolling
JSON-RPC, calling the REST ability runner from shell, or running shell `wp ...`
commands.


## Direct + plugin REST parity surfaces

Plugin abilities and Direct tools cover comments, users (including application passwords), widgets, allowlisted settings, themes, plugin lifecycle, revisions (with restore on the plugin), site health tests, search/oEmbed, and WooCommerce product/order/sales reads.

## MCP tool surface switching (premium finalization)

Profile and surface switching is transport-specific. Agents should treat
`tools_changed` / `re_list_instruction` on ability results as the source of truth.

### HTTP MCP transport (plugin adapter)

- **Admin option** `stonewright_mcp_surface`: `bootstrap` | `essential` | `full`
  controls which abilities the plugin exposes on `tools/list`.
- Each `tools/list` request re-reads the live surface from WordPress options —
  there is **no sticky tool list** for the HTTP transport. After
  `stonewright-tool-profile` activate or admin Apply-now, the next `tools/list`
  already reflects the new surface.
- The vendor initialize payload may not declare `tools.listChanged`. Clients
  must honor `re_list_instruction` in the ability response and call `tools/list`
  again even when no `notifications/tools/list_changed` arrives.
- **OAuth 2.1** for the HTTP transport is planned, not scheduled.

### stdio companion transport

- `STONEWRIGHT_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE` sets only the **initial** compact profile for
  the companion process. Mid-session
  `stonewright-tool-profile {action:"activate"}` and profile-aware
  `stonewright-task-start` results may expand or switch the live set.
- When a proxied ability result includes `tools_changed: true` **or** a
  non-empty `re_list_instruction`, the companion:
  1. Re-fetches `tools/list` from the plugin (schemas for newly visible tools).
  2. Diffs against registered proxy tools (register missing, disable dropped).
  3. Emits `notifications/tools/list_changed` via the MCP protocol server.
- Clients that ignore `list_changed` must still re-call `tools/list` using
  `re_list_instruction`. Older companions that only notify (or neither) need an
  MCP client / companion restart after a profile upgrade.

### Shared ability signals

- **`stonewright-tool-profile` activate**: expands `stonewright_mcp_surface`
  when leaving bootstrap and sets `tools_changed` + `re_list_instruction`.
- **`stonewright-task-start`**: surfaces `tool_profile`, `tools_changed`, and
  `re_list_instruction` so agents are not silent after profile activation.
